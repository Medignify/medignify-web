            <p class="body-large">Because our Services support health and medication management, we will process
                health-related personal data when you use the health features. Processing of health data requires
                explicit consent where applicable. You must not provide another person's health data without their
                consent. We will use health data only to provide the Services you request (e.g., reminders,</p>
            <p class="body-large">medication tracking, AI-search), to improve the Services as permitted by law, or as
                otherwise described in this Policy.</p>

            <h2 class="title-large">7. Legal bases for processing (EU/UK users)</h2>
            <p class="body-large">Where GDPR/UK GDPR applies, we rely on the following legal bases:</p>
            <ul class="body-large">
                <li>Consent: for core health functionality where explicit consent is required, for AI-assisted features,
                    and for marketing where applicable.</li>
                <li>Performance of a contract: to provide Services you have requested (e.g., account creation,
                    medication reminders).</li>
                <li>Legitimate interests: for operations, product improvement, fraud prevention, security, and
                    aggregated analytics, provided your rights are not overridden.</li>
                <li>Legal obligations: to comply with applicable laws, safety reporting, or law enforcement requests.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="title-large">8. How we use your information</h2>
            <p class="body-large">We use personal data for the following purposes:</p>

                    any content you provide to an AI provider. Do not include sensitive health details in free-text AI
                    queries unless you consent to that transmission. AI outputs are for informational purposes only and
                    are not a substitute for professional medical advice.</li>
                <li>We do not sell AI inputs or outputs. AI responses are generated by third parties and may be retained
                    by those providers under their terms; you should review the privacy policies of the applicable AI
                    provider(s).</li>
                <li>To send service messages and notifications (e.g., reminders, system messages).</li>
